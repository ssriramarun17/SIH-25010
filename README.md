SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
“We propose a mobile/web platform that helps farmers predict crop yield and optimize fertilizer usage using satellite data and AI-based recommendations.”

## Technical Approach
Technologies to be used: programming languages, frameworks, APIs, or hardware (e.g., Python, Node.js, Flutter, Arduino, IoT sensors, etc.)

Methodology: How you’ll implement the solution step-by-step.

Flowcharts/Diagrams/Prototype: Add a small diagram or screenshot showing your app’s structure or workflow (optional but impressive).

## Feasibility and Viability
Explain why your idea is practical and how it can be implemented at scale:

Analysis: Why the solution is feasible with current tech/resources.

Potential impact: Who benefits and how (e.g., farmers, govt., consumers).

Challenges: Mention risks and how you’ll handle them.

## Impact and Benefits
Environmental impact (less pesticide, less waste).

Economic benefits (increased income, reduced costs).

Social benefits (improved quality of life).
